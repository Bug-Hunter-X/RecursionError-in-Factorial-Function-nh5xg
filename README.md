# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions:  forgetting to handle edge cases, specifically negative input in the factorial function. The factorial function is not defined for negative numbers.  This will lead to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`.

The `bug.py` file contains the faulty code that causes the error.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
